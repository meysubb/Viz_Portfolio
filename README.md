## Data Visualization Portfolio

This repository has all the code for my data visualization portfolio. The corresponding data is also provided, if you would like to replicate these.

This data was gathered from courses taught by professors at the McCombs School of Business (UT).

Currently all visualizations are produced via R, look to see for python code in the near future.
